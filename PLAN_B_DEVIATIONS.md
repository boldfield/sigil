## 2026-04-25 — [Task 4.5.5 / A3-carryover] Tagged-vs-raw Int ABI decision

**Context:** Plan A3's `QUESTIONS.md` entry `[PLAN-A3] main-return-tagging`
(resolved 2026-04-24) explicitly reopened the broader ABI question for
Plan B: should internal user-function calls pass `Int` as tagged 64-bit
values, or as raw `i64` with tagging only at the C-ABI boundary? The
effect-runtime CPS transform (Stage 6 Task 55) and trampoline machinery
need a definitive answer before they ship.

Today's codebase:
- User functions compute on **raw `i64`** (no tagging in body-local
  arithmetic).
- **Tagging happens only at `main`'s return**: codegen emits
  `ishl_imm TAG_INT_SHIFT` on the Int value and the generated C-main
  shim emits `sshr_imm TAG_INT_SHIFT` + `ireduce I32` to produce the
  process exit code.
- Heap-stored `Int` values (closure env slots, user-type field slots)
  currently flow through as whatever Cranelift `Value` the field type
  resolves to — `I64` for `Int`. This avoids GC surprises because GC
  only scans pointer-typed slots via the pointer bitmap; non-pointer
  fields are opaque payloads.

**Decision:** keep the current pattern — raw `i64` internally within
user code, tag at the C-ABI boundary only. Effect-runtime CPS work in
Stage 6 layers onto this by introducing *new* boundary moments:

1. **Continuations captured across handler boundaries** (the
   `current_k` that `sigil_perform` passes to handler arms) must
   carry tagged `Int` arguments, because a captured continuation can
   sit on the heap in a `HandlerFrame` slot that the GC scans.
2. **`NextStep` records arena-allocated by the trampoline** keep
   their args untagged (raw `i64`) for arithmetic cycles. The arena
   is reset per dispatch and never scanned by the Boehm collector;
   raw values here avoid tag/untag churn on the hot trampoline path.

This is option (c)'s "raw everywhere internally, tag at the C-ABI
boundary" applied to user-fn calls specifically, plus a narrower
tag-at-heap-observability rule for continuations and handler-scope
slots. It is compatible with the A3 resolution (main → Int locked)
because main's C-ABI boundary was already the one tagging site.

**Rationale:**
1. **Minimal code churn in this PR.** The existing pattern is already
   "raw internally". Formalising the decision without rewriting every
   user-fn call site keeps the diff focused.
2. **Tagging is a GC-discipline question, not a performance one.**
   Heap-observable slots need tags so the GC can tell Int from
   pointer. Non-heap slots don't. Arena-allocated `NextStep` records
   are non-heap (arena is reset, not scanned); continuations are
   heap (scanned), so they need tagged payloads.
3. **CPS hot path stays tight.** Arithmetic-dense CPS-color code
   (fib under `!State[Int]`) will dispatch through the trampoline
   billions of times per `fib(30)` invocation. Every tag/untag pair
   saved on the hot path matters for the Task 60 performance floor.
4. **One constant to audit.** `sigil_abi::tag::TAG_INT_SHIFT` is the
   single reference for the shift amount. Stage 6's new tagging sites
   consume it too. A future revisit would edit one place.

**Audit of `ishl_imm` / `sshr_imm` sites (2026-04-25):**

| file                     | site                 | purpose                                | status              |
|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|
| compiler/src/codegen.rs  | user-main return     | tag `Int` for C-ABI exit code          | updated to TAG_INT_SHIFT |
| compiler/src/codegen.rs  | C-main shim untag    | untag tagged `Int` → raw → `ireduce I32` | updated to TAG_INT_SHIFT |

No other tag-shift sites exist in the compiler or runtime today.
`from_int` / `as_int` in `sigil_runtime::value` already consume
`TAG_INT_SHIFT` as of Task 4.5.5.

entry's Forward-Implications paragraph is now closed by this decision.
